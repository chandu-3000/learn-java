# Learn JAVA

## How Java Works.
* Java is a object-oriented, high-level programming language
* Java is a WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere).
* JDK -> JRE -> JVM (For Development) (Write once here).
* JRE -> JVM (For Production). (Run AnyWhere).
## String
* String class is immutable, it doesn't change the existing string, it will create new object. so even if you add a single character, it will create a new string object. (Not recommended).
* StringBuilder was introduced to solve this problem, but it is not thread-safe.
* StringBuffer is thread-safe, both StringBuffer & StringBuilder has apis.
